Description: This package generates interactive visualisations of RNA-sequencing data based
             on output from limma, edgeR or DESeq2. Interactions are built on top of popular
             static displays from the limma package, providing users with access to gene IDs
             and sample information. Plots are generated using d3.js and displayed in HTML pages.
